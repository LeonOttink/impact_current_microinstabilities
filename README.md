# The impact of currents on microinstabilities in fusion plasmas
This repository acts as a supplement to the MSc thesis "The impact of currents on microinstabilities in fusion plasmas". It contains the python code used for data processing and making visualizations for the thesis. Data from GENE simulations for cross-phases and velocity-space structure of eigenfunctions is provided as `.dat` files, other data is part of the Jupyter notebook file.

## Requirements
Python 3.12.4, and various standard python packages.
